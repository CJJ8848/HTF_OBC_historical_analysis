#now we use step2 to query the dump, m57 keeps no change, but h40 first rmdup...

#dump_out=$wd/step2_isolate_kmers/isolate_jf/dump

for all h40 and m55:
but after week59, we change the strategy to first subset the fastq to reads mapped to OTU5 and then ask the kmer counts in this read pool (requires only the library, dont need assembly/reference)... (dont need p25.c2 unique wg kmers):

step1: from bam markdup (done) and rmdup, extract reads (we have the bam/fastq in tailocin_46/isolates_fastq that mapped to OTU5 ref +7HTF and TFA) 

step2: then count kmer to jf file then dump -c to human readable count.  

step3: do a dist (m55 benchmark and h40)

step4: simulate co-infection (eg two genomes in a single strain, normalize depth to the same level and then put them into one panel with different color/transparent).
