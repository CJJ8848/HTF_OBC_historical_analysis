> In **step5_additional_analysis**, I:
> - Run coinfection detection
> - Isolates that break the HTF-OBC pattern:
>   - Remove `64.GBR` as a uncertain calls  
>   - Confirm `PL0240` as a confident break
> - [See analysis summary slides] here(https://github.com/JiajunCui-jjc/HTF_OBC_historical_analysis/tree/5674707e4d0ed4b5442bdbd3c2bb40522701eb2d/results/step1_HTFhaplotypes/step1.2_HTF_bykmers/step4_additionalanalysis/step2_coinfection/summary_breaking_coninfection)
> - Calculate HTF length group frequency differences, plot boxplots and raw data versus time and geography [See plots](https://github.com/JiajunCui-jjc/HTF_OBC_historical_analysis/tree/5674707e4d0ed4b5442bdbd3c2bb40522701eb2d/results/step1_HTFhaplotypes/step1.2_HTF_bykmers/step4_additionalanalysis/step3_HTFfreq).
