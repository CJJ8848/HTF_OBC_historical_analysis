first run py script to build a hamming distance pairwise matrix, then R visual to visualize it
second run the step2.sh to iteratively filter the kmers_unique which is whole genome excluded  unique kmers. Then we have the final kmers_unique_hamming2 as the reference kmers to query isolates


iterative filtering from the smallest library to the largest to keep as much as possible the two small HTf kmer pools: 
(exclude any dist<2 kmers from the accumulative kmers pool)

️ Processing HTF_p23.B8
kept all 31 kmers from HTF_p23.B8

️ Processing HTF_p26.D6
kept 15 kmers from HTF_p26.D6 (removed 29 conflicting kmers)

️ Processing HTF_p21.F9
kept 746 kmers from HTF_p21.F9 (removed 0 conflicting kmers)

️ Processing HTF_p25.A12
kept 777 kmers from HTF_p25.A12 (removed 0 conflicting kmers)

️ Processing HTF_p5.D5
kept 993 kmers from HTF_p5.D5 (removed 5 conflicting kmers)

️ Processing HTF_p7.G11
kept 1063 kmers from HTF_p7.G11 (removed 136 conflicting kmers)

️ Processing HTF_p25.C2
kept 1167 kmers from HTF_p25.C2 (removed 45 conflicting kmers)
